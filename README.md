# PATHsafe_QC

## Aims of the project:
-   Evaluate genome assembly pipelines for Salmoella
    A comparison of different genome assembly pipelines for accuracy in Salmonella
    genome construction from Illumina short reads. This will include SOAPdenovo,
    Velvet, Abyss, SPAdes, SKESA, Unicycler, IDBA, Megahit, and possibly others.
    Quality metrics will include use of Quast (https://quast.sourceforge.net).

-   Amend Enterobase pipeline in light of results
-   Make QC pipeline readily interoperable
-   Write report
